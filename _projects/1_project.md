### Introduction

<div class="justified-text">
  My project focuses on harnessing the power of bioinformatics and multimodal data analysis to advance our understanding of complex, multifactorial diseases. The aim is to integrate various high-dimensional datasets, including single-cell data, RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, and more, to uncover the molecular pathology and regulatory networks underlying diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. This integrative approach will facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and personalized treatment strategies.

### Research Areas

**1. Single Cell Data Analysis**
- **scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq**: I analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-Seq) data to explore cellular heterogeneity, identify distinct cell populations, and understand the gene regulatory mechanisms at a single-cell resolution.
- **Spatial Transcriptomics**: This technique allows me to map gene expression in the spatial context of tissue architecture, providing insights into the spatial organization of cells and their functional states within tissues.

**2. RNA Splicing and Processing Analysis**
- **RNA-Seq Based Data**: By analyzing RNA-Seq data, I investigate RNA splicing and processing events, which play critical roles in gene regulation and the manifestation of multifactorial diseases. Understanding these processes can reveal new aspects of disease pathology and potential therapeutic interventions.

**3. Genomic Data Analysis**
- **Peak Calling**: I use peak calling algorithms to identify regions of the genome that are bound by proteins, such as transcription factors, providing insights into gene regulation.
- **Variant Calling**: My variant calling analysis detects genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which can contribute to disease susceptibility and progression.

**4. Epigenomic Data Analysis**
- **DNA Methylation**: I study DNA methylation patterns to understand their role in gene expression regulation and disease. Aberrant methylation patterns can serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and targets for epigenetic therapies.
- **Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Analysis**: QTL analysis helps me identify genomic regions associated with quantitative traits, linking genetic variations to phenotypic outcomes.

**5. Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms**
I apply advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to bioinformatics data to uncover hidden patterns, make predictions, and generate new hypotheses. These algorithms are essential for handling the complexity and high dimensionality of multimodal datasets.

**6. Molecular Pathology of Multifactorial Diseases**
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: I investigate the gene regulatory networks behind multifactorial diseases to understand how genes interact and regulate each other in disease contexts.
- **Signaling Pathways**: My research delves into the signaling pathways implicated in multifactorial diseases, aiming to uncover key nodes and interactions that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.
- **Cell-Cell Communication**: Understanding how cells communicate and influence each other's behavior in disease states is crucial. I explore cell-cell communication networks to identify potential points of intervention.
- **Perturbation Model Generation**: I generate perturbation models to simulate the effects of genetic or environmental changes on disease progression, helping to predict the outcomes of potential treatments.


### Innovations and Applications
- **Cheap Screening**: By integrating diverse datasets and applying cutting-edge algorithms, I aim to develop cost-effective screening methods for early disease detection.
- **Cheap Treatments**: My goal is to identify affordable and effective treatment options by leveraging the understanding of molecular pathology and regulatory networks.
